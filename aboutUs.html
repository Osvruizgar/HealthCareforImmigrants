        Health for All understands that many immigrants in america, can't afford
        or be eligiable for healthcare. It is our goal to provide services and
        products for immigrants without insurance and without the outrages cost
        that come with healthcare.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraphs">
        Though our main priority is short term, we plan to fight for states to
        give healthcare to the undocument and provide more support to immigrants
        in low-income communities.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraphs">
        We have partnered with an organization that doubles the amount of each purchase
        and returns it back to us to keep up with costs.

        “Let us be the ones who say we do not accept that a child dies every
        three seconds simply because he does not have the drugs you and I have.
        Let us be the ones to say we are not satisfied that your place of birth
        determines your right for life. Let us be outraged, let us be loud, let
        us be bold.” <br />-Brad Pitt

            This is Naiya Patal, she just like many immigrants waited till she can no longer bare the
            pain from her body and seeked medical treatment. However she does not have insurance nor
            financal support outside of her husbands income. After her evaluation, she was told to
            have a hip replacement surgery on both hips or she wont be able to walk ever again. Her
            total cost was $160,000. Her first bill was $80,000 and be paid 2 months after her surgery.
